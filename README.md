<h1>🚀 Search Engine Generative AI App Development Using Streamlit</h1>

<h3>🌟 Excited to share my latest project!</h3>

<h2>🔑 Project Overview:</h2>
I developed a Generative AI-powered Search Engine Application using Streamlit, designed to deliver precise and efficient responses to user queries. The application mimics the functionality of a search engine like Wikipedia but goes a step further by leveraging advanced AI techniques.

If a user's query is not addressed by Wikipedia, the app utilizes the GROQ model (Gemma2-9b-It) to generate relevant answers, ensuring a seamless experience.
The application integrates agent-based techniques for dynamic query handling and improved problem-solving capabilities.
This project demonstrates how Generative AI can elevate search experiences by providing intelligent and adaptive solutions.
